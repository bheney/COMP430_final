All data pipes that receive data must be enabled ( EN_RXADDR register),
enable auto acknowledgement for all pipes running
Enhanced ShockBurstTM ( EN_AA register), and set the correct payload widths ( RX_PW_Px regis-
ters).
Set up addresses as described in item 2 in the Enhanced ShockBurstTM transmitting pay-
load example above.
Start Active RX mode by setting CE high.
After 130Î¼s nRF24L01+ monitors the air for incoming communication.
When a valid packet is received (matching address and correct CRC), the payload is stored in the
RX-FIFO, and the RX_DR bit in STATUS register is set high. The IRQ pin is active when RX_DR is
high. RX_P_NO in STATUS register indicates what data pipe the payload has been received in.
If auto acknowledgement is enabled, an ACK packet is transmitted back, unless the NO_ACK bit
is set in the received packet. If there is a payload in the TX_PLD FIFO, this payload is added to
the ACK packet.
MCU sets the CE pin low to enter standby-I mode (low current mode).
MCU can clock out the payload data at a suitable rate through the SPI.
nRF24L01+ is now ready for entering TX or RX mode or power down mode.
